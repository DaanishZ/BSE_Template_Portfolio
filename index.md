# Phone Controlled Robot Arm
My project will use an arduino and an android app to control a robot arm. This will be done using servo motors connected to the robot arm and arduino. The app must be able to establish a connection and control the robot arm. This robot arm will be able to do simple tasks such as holding onto items, picking up items, and pushing items away.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone involved using an Arduino, HC-05 Bluetooth module, and Android application to move a servo motor. One of my challenges was uploading to code to the Arduino. I did not realize at first that I had to unplug my HC-05 in order to upload my code without error. After I figured this out, my code uploaded properly. Another challenge included connecting the Arduino to my phone. My phone kept connecting to other bluetooth devices. I fixed this error by unpairing any other bluetooth devices so that my bluetooth module was the only available connection.
